OSmap is a network visualization tool that performs passive OS discovery for hosts present in a given network traffic capture.  

OSmap depends on using the pyshark python module, which is a python wrapper for tshark that allows the parsing of packets. The documentation and source code for pyshark can be found at https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark. Credit to KimiNewt.
